I worked with an amazing food writer to put together a resource for different salad dressings. These are just base guidelines and not super defined recipes but hopefully it gives you a good place to start for inspiration! Making your own dressing is super rewarding and easy to nail down once you get the ratios/emulsification part right and really helps to elevate your salad. My personal favorite is vinaigrette with just oil, lemon juice, and mustard whisked together with a bit of salt and pepper.

I actually made the thousand island dressing as it was listed below but with Greek yogurt instead of mayo and it was AWESOME!

# Vinaigrettes
The simplest salad dressing—and an easy recipe to riff on with your own favorite flavors—is the classic vinaigrette, using oil, vinegar, and mustard. The standard ratio is three parts oil to one part vinegar, and the most basic version uses olive oil, white wine vinegar, and a dollop of mustard, plus salt and pepper. But there’s no reason to hold off there: switching the vinegar for a balsamic or Champagne upgrades it instantly, while using a citrus juice like lemon, lime, or grapefruit brings a fun zing. You can get creative with other oils, like avocado, pumpkin seed, or hazelnut. And the mustard can be switched out for a little honey if that matches the other flavors better.

## Standard Vinaigrette

All you really need is oil, vinegar, and a bit of emulsifier—usually mustard—to pull this standard together.

Recipe:

* 3:1 oil and vinegar ratio
* 1 teaspoon mustard (dijon or whole grain)
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Italian Dressing

This tabletop favorite is actually just a basic olive oil and red or white wine vinegar vinaigrette mixed with a few herbs—fresh parsley and dried basil, oregano, and red pepper—with lemon juice and garlic.

Recipe:

* 3:1 oil and vinegar ratio
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
* Dried basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 2 fresh garlic cloves, minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Balsamic Vinaigrette

Balsamic vinegar makes a tart and sweet base for salads, so it’s a common vinaigrette ingredient, usually with a splash of honey to bring it together.

Recipe:

* 3:1 oil and balsamic vinegar ratio
* Salt and pepper to taste

# Caesar Salad Dressing
Like a vinaigrette, Caesar salad dressing is an emulsion: the egg yolk works as the emulsifying agent and the lemon juice as the acid. The extra ingredients—pepper, anchovies, and Parmesan—just help to emulsify it. This is useful knowledge for anyone trying to make a riff on the dish: don’t like using raw eggs? Just use some mayonnaise or even yogurt in place of the egg yolk. Feeling like tweaking it? Try it with lime, or go with yuzu juice. Just like the standard vinaigrette, once you master the ratio, playing with flavors becomes easier.

## Caesar Dressing

Perhaps one of the most iconic single dressings in American cuisine, this dressing gets its body from a raw egg yolk mixed with oil, and its flavor from a trio of big guns: anchovies, parmesan, and garlic.

Recipe:

* 2 large egg yolks
* 2 minced garlic cloves
* 1 teaspoon anchovy paste
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 1/2 cup freshly grated Parm cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

(Whisk everything except olive oil and parm cheese...slowly incorporate oil until emulsified, whisk in cheese, season with salt/pepper)

## Mayo-based Caesar Dressing

For the squeamish, the immunity-compromised, or the lazy, the ready-made emulsion of mayonnaise makes it easy to simply stir in the flavor components of Caesar dressing and then it with a little extra lemon juice.

Recipe:

* 1 cup mayo (or greek yogurt)
* 2 minced garlic cloves
* 1 teaspoon anchovy paste
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 1/2 cup freshly grated Parm cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

# Creamy Dressings

Creamy dressings—like green goddess or ranch dressing—tend to do well with heartier salads and chunkier vegetables, as they may weigh down fragile greens. While cream itself is an emulsion, the truth is most of the creamy salad dressings you’re familiar with come from a mayonnaise base, which makes them even easier to make than a vinaigrette. And, in most cases, you can swap out the mayo for yogurt or Greek yogurt for a lighter or tangier version. For most of these, you can just toss all the ingredients into a blender and whiz together your favorite dressing.

***All versions below can use greek yogurt instead of mayo, sour cream, or buttermilk***

## Blue Cheese

The funky flavor of blue cheese gets tangy with mayonnaise and sour cream or buttermilk in this big-flavor American classic that’s simple to stir together.

Recipe:

* 1 cup mayonnaise (or mixture of mayo/sour cream/buttermilk)
* 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
* 1/2 cup half and half
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* Salt and pepper to taste

You can whisk all blue cheese with ingredients, or whisk half and then add half at the end for a chunkier option.

## Green Goddess

Practically synonymous with fresh flavors, this California specialty packs in a truckload of herbs, brought together with a little mayonnaise and sour cream (and sometimes avocado, in a modern version)

Recipe:

* 1 teaspoon anchovy paste (optional)
* 1 garlic clove, minced.
* 3/4 cup mayonnaise (or greek yogurt)
* 3/4 cup sour cream (or greek yogurt)
* 1/2 cup chopped parsley
* 1/4 cup chopped tarragon
* 2 scallions, minced
* 3 Tbsp chopped chives
* 2 Tbsp lemon juice

You can also add spinach to get more greens!

## Ranch

America’s favorite buttermilk-herb dressing went from a niche restaurant product to mainstream quickly, and has now taken on an iconic spot on grocery shelves. Use herbs such as fresh (or dried) dill, parsley, and fresh green onions or fresh/dried chives.

Recipe:

* 1 cup Mayonnaise (or Greek yogurt)
* ½ cup Sour Cream
* ½ cup Buttermilk
* 2 tablespoons fresh minced dill (or 2 tsps dry)
* 2 tablespoons fresh minced parsley (or 2 tsps dry)
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* Sugar, to taste
* Salt and pepper to taste

# Mayonnaise-based Dressings

Mayonnaise on its own makes for an easy base (and, again, easily substituted for yogurt) and has become the base of at least two favorites: Russian and Thousand Island. Both begin with a mayo base and take much of their flavor from ketchup without any additional creaminess coming in later, Russian veers toward horseradish for sharpness and thousand island uses sweet pickle relish.

## Russian Dressing
From a base of mayonnaise and ketchup, the horseradish and hot sauce lift this into a creamy, sharp dressing.

Recipe:

* 1 cup mayonnaise
* 1/4 cup ketchup
* 1 tablespoon onion finely minced
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Hot sauce to taste
* Horseradish to taste

## Thousand Island

Like an overturned condiment cart, thousand island mixes mayonnaise, ketchup, and relish, with vinegar and garlic, for a unique and tangy dressing.

Recipe:

* 1 cup mayonnaise
* 1/4 cup ketchup
* 1 tablespoon onion finely minced
* 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
* 2 teaspoons relish
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* Salt and pepper to taste

# Alternative Dressings

Who says your salad dressing needs to use any of these classic methods? Nobody! While the texture of emulsification tends to do well, there are other ways to get the same texture or others that work well for salads: tahini as a base, using chia seeds in a citrus-based liquid, and even just blending up large amounts herbs like mint and parsley with a light oil until they just come together.

## Tahini Dressing

The sesame seed paste known as tahini comes already thick and creamy, so turning it into a salad dressing simple requires thinning it out with a bit of lemon juice and olive oil and then adding flavors—from basic chopped garlic to spicy pickled peppers.

Recipe

* 1/2 cup tahini
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* Salt, pepper, and cayenne powder to taste

## Herb Dressing

There’s no rules on this one, just clean up whatever herbs are floating in your fridge or garden, and drizzle with a touch of oil before blending. Play around by adding garlic, capers, pickled shallots, or anything else you have on hand.

Recipe

* 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1/2 cup minced mixed fresh herbs (parsley, basil, dill, thyme)
* 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar (or lemon juice)
* 2 tablespoons honey and/or dijon mustard

## Chia Dressing

Chia seeds will thicken any liquid, so letting them work their magic on whatever your favorite flavors are turns them into a salad dressing. Mix ingredients, like blueberry and lemon juice, or orange juice and chopped chipotle peppers in adobo, and then let sit for an hour with the seeds before stirring and serving.

Recipe:

* 3:1 oil and vinegar ratio
* 2 teaspoons chia seeds
* 1 teaspoon mustard (dijon or whole grain)
* 1 teaspoon honey
* Salt and pepper to taste
