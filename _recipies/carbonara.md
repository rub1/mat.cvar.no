- 1 large egg

## RECIPE PREPARATION
Cook guanciale in a large skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until fat renders but guanciale is not browned, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving ? cup pasta cooking liquid.

Immediately add rigatoni, 2 Tbsp. pasta cooking liquid, and 1 tsp. guanciale drippings to egg mixture; toss to coat. Working in 3 batches, gradually add ? cup Pecorino, stirring and tossing to melt between batches. Add 2 tsp. black pepper; toss until sauce thickens, adding more pasta water by tablespoonfuls if needed. Season with salt and pepper.

Divide among bowls. Garnish with Pecorino.
