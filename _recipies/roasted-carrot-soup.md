## Ingredients

- Roughly 1 pound (465g) carrots, washed, dried and cut into 1/2 inch coins
- 1 tablespoon (13.05g) coconut oil
- 1/2 tablespoon garam masala
- 5 cloves garlic, skins smashed but left on
- 1/2 inch (7g) knob fresh ginger, peeled and minced or 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 large white onion (100g to 150g), cut into quarters and separated (to prevent burning)
- 3 cups great quality vegetable broth, boiling hot*
- 1 13.5 oz (400g) can coconut milk
- juice of one medium sized lime
- 3/4 teaspoon sea salt

###Optional

- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- More ginger if desired
- Pinch of cayenne or a scotch bonnet/habanero pepper added in for heat

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F/218 degrees C.
2. On a large sheet pan prepared with a silicone mat, parchment or foil, add the carrots and the onions. Drizzle the olive oil over the vegetables and the garam masala. Season with a grinding of fresh sea salt and ground black pepper. Rub the seasonings and oil into the vegetables and spread out. Add the garlic in with the vegetables at this point.
3. Roast for 30 to 35 minutes, turning halfway, until veggies are roasted and carrots are fork tender.
4. Remove from oven and remove the skins from the garlic.
5. In a large blender, add all the remaining ingredients with the vegetables. Ensure that the broth is very hot. If you're not using large blender (holds at least 6 cups) then do this in increments.
6. Using the soup setting on your blender, or a very powerful blend option, blend until creamy and smooth. My blender automatically blends for about 3 minutes continuously.
7. Taste and add salt and pepper to taste if necessary.
8. Top with garnish (I used fennel fronds since I had in the fridge, but parsley, chives or dill work just as fine) and a pinch of cayenne for a bit of heat.
9. Serve into bowls and enjoy!
