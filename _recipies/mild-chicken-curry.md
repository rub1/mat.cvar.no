## Ingredients

- Chicken – 300g, or 2 breast pieces, diced.
- Onion – 1, finely chopped
- Ginger–garlic paste – 1 tsp
- Garam masala(1) – 2 tbsp, with some salt thrown in
- Potatoes – 2, peeled and cubed
- Tomatoes – 3, puréed(2)
- Water – 1 cup, add extra as needed
- Coconut milk – 1 1/2 cups
- Coriander, onion – Chopped, for garnish
- Lemon – 1/2, squeezed

## Method

1. Coat base of pan with oil and let it heat up(3).
2. Add onions and fry until translucent.
3. Throw in the ginger–garlic paste and toss with onions(4).
4. Now, add the potatoes and continue to fry(5).
5. Slide the chicken in and toss until the chicken isn’t pink(5).
6. At this point, you can add in the garam masala and mix further so that everything is coated in the masala.
7. If the pot is looking a bit dry and smoky, you can add a bit more oil.
8. Add the tomato puree with a bit of water, allowing it to simmer.
9. Pour the rest of the water in small amounts, making sure to stir well as you do so.
10. Let it come to a boil, then turn the heat down to simmer and put a lid on it for about 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are done cooking.
11. Once that’s done, add in the coconut milk. Turn the heat up and allow it to boil.
12. Turn the heat down once more, add the garnish, and squeeze the lemon.
13. Serve hot with rice(6)!

## Notes & Helpful Advice

1. Garam masala is super easy to make at home if you don’t have any. The basic garam masala has a combination of ground peppercorns, cardamom, and cinnamon, chilli powder, turmeric powder, and salt.
2. When you’re making your own purée of tomatoes, remember to add some salt to it. You can also add some turmeric and chilli powder. Yes, these are everywhere. Note that you add only 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric and 1/4 teaspoon of chilli powder or the flavour (and colour, especially from the turmeric) overpowers everything else.
3. For those of you who are new to cooking, please remember the following order: pan to flame, heat up; oil to pan, heat up; and only then do ingredients go in the pan.
4. At this point, things are going to start sticking to the pan. That’s okay, but you should reduce the flame to medium (or sim it altogether) if you’re an idiot who forgot to purée his tomatoes. Otherwise, it will burn.
5. I’ve not marinated my chicken in anything for this recipe as the gravy has enough flavour; however, the chicken is coated in pepper, salt, and a mixture of dried herbs from a jar. Oh, and turmeric and chilli powder.
6. As this is a bit of a watery gravy, it doesn’t pair well with chapathis or naans. It’s best served with rice; basmati, if you have it. It also goes great with idlis the next day.
